Goals

* familiar to C programmers
* good for "bare metal" programming, no runtime system requirements
* little or no hidden overhead, doesn't run a lot of implicit code
* get rid of the preprocessor
* code import system that's semantically simpler than #include
* order of global definitions and imports doesn't matter
* interface and implementation in separate files
* data hiding through interface files, not private keyword
* namespaces
* recommended consistent file organization, build procedure, package deployment
* clearer, easier to parse type syntax
* code can be parsed without a symbol table
* constants that are usable at compile time
* constant functions usable at compile time
* stricter enums, and different enum types
