== Introduction
Moss is a C-like language, but it is not backward compatible with C.
The goals of Moss include:

* The language has well-specified ways to directly access memory and
  memory-mapped resources.
* The core langauge does not depend on significant operating system or
  runtime library support.
* Replacing the C file include mechanism with a import system that makes
  managing dependencies easier.
* Providing a consistent structure for code modules that allows standardization
  of build tools.
